## Achievements

### Guinness World Record Holder*
Beat the world record but lost some data so must complete and submit again. Expected approval timeline is 12/2024.
Record was attempted in part of a charity livestream event my friends and I do every year near Christmas time. The charity
events have raised $500+ in the last two years and we look to continue and grow that trend. To learn more, or if you want
to help, contact me through my webstie [here](https://braydenvernon.com/#contact)!

### 5th Place Game Making @ Heartland Gaming Expo (2016)
High school experience where a few friends and I made a very basic Unity game where our game competed against competitors of all levels, including university teams from Tulsa University and Oklahoma State (Tulsa).
Took 5th place in the Game Creator category with our basic horror genre game called "The Penitentiary" where the player was meant to run to shelter after being stranded in the woods and chased by a smoke monster.

### 1st Place - Midtown Throwdown 05/2024
Achieved first place in the MA2 division, and also getting an Ace (Hole in 1) on what was marked as a par 4. This league event had 8 players in my division and 3 rounds.
